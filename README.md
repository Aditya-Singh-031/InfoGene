# InfoGene



\# InfoGene - Gene Analysis and Annotation Platform



\## Overview



InfoGene is a comprehensive project designed to facilitate gene sequence analysis and annotation for human genes. It integrates programmatic data retrieval from NCBI databases, sequence processing, and visualization to empower researchers with detailed genomic insights. The project includes a Jupyter notebook that automates fetching gene, transcript, and exon data; as well as a professional, user-friendly web platform that allows interactive gene analysis with downloadable results.

\## Jupyter Notebook (`InfoGene.ipynb`)



The Jupyter notebook serves as the programmatic backbone of InfoGene. It performs the following key tasks:



\- Takes a gene symbol or NCBI Gene ID as input.

\- Queries the NCBI Entrez Gene database to fetch the gene summary and essential metadata.

\- Uses multiple search strategies to retrieve genomic (RefSeqGene), mRNA (RefSeq NM\_), and transcript sequences associated with the gene.

\- Downloads and saves FASTA files for genomic and mRNA sequences.

\- Extracts exon details from Ensembl data, saving exon tables as CSV files.

\- Fetches and processes additional features such as promoter regions, transcription start sites (TSS), 3' UTR exons, and polyadenylation sites.

\- Facilitates export of detailed gene reports, including sequence data and structural annotations.



The notebook is designed for automation and reproducibility, requiring only minimal user input for gene identification and supports custom configuration of NCBI API keys.

\## Website



InfoGene also offers a fully functional, professional web application for gene sequence analysis and annotation, hosted at:



https://aditya-singh-031.github.io/InfoGene/


\### Features of the Website



\- Input form for gene symbol or NCBI Gene ID and required email for NCBI API compliance.

\- Stepwise progress tracking of gene search and sequence retrieval simulation.

\- Display of detailed gene summaries including chromosomal location, aliases, and gene function.

\- Presentation of found genomic accessions, mRNA transcripts, and exon structure in collapsible, well-organized sections.

\- Downloadable FASTA and CSV files for genomic sequences, mRNA transcripts, and exon data.

\- Responsive and accessible UI with modern styling and smooth animations for a professional user experience.

\- Robust input validation and user guidance for error handling and troubleshooting.



The website is designed to provide researchers and users a no-code interface to explore gene sequences and annotations easily, complementing the programmatic power of the Jupyter notebook.
